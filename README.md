#The Broken Rights

This website serves a simple purpose: to expose the hypocrisies and the corruption inside of the American School System. The table below is a list of every law the school system has broken and wether the problem was addressed. If the issue was resolved the table will reflect so. This website will forever serve as a reminder to what the school system once was. (Sources are listed in the footer)
